 * Testcase Example:  '["w","wo","wor","worl","world"]'
 *
 * Given an array of strings words representing an English Dictionary, return
 * the longest word in words that can be built one character at a time by other
 * words in words.
 * 
 * If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the
 * smallest lexicographical order. If there is no answer, return the empty
 * string.
 * 
 * Note that the word should be built from left to right with each additional
 * character being added to the end of a previous word.Â 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: words = ["w","wo","wor","worl","world"]
 * Output: "world"
 * Explanation: The word "world" can be built one character at a time by "w",
 * "wo", "wor", and "worl".
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: words = ["a","banana","app","appl","ap","apply","apple"]
 * Output: "apple"
 * Explanation: Both "apply" and "apple" can be built from other words in the
 * dictionary. However, "apple" is lexicographically smaller than "apply".
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= words.length <= 1000
 * 1 <= words[i].length <= 30
 * words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

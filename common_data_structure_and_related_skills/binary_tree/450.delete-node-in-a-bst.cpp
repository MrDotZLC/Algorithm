 *
 * Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the
 * given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of
 * the BST.
 * 
 * Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:
 * 
 * 
 * Search for a node to remove.
 * If the node is found, delete the node.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
 * Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
 * Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and
 * delete it.
 * One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
 * Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's
 * also accepted.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
 * Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
 * Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [], key = 0
 * Output: []
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
 * -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
 * Each node has a unique value.
 * root is a valid binary search tree.
 * -10^5 <= key <= 10^5
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up: Could you solve it with time complexity O(height of tree)?
 *

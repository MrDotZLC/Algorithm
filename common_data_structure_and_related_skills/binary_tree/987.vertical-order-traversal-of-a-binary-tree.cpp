 *
 * Given the root of a binary tree, calculate the vertical order traversal of
 * the binary tree.
 * 
 * For each node at position (row, col), its left and right children will be at
 * positions (row + 1, col - 1) and (row + 1, col + 1) respectively. The root
 * of the tree is at (0, 0).
 * 
 * The vertical order traversal of a binary tree is a list of top-to-bottom
 * orderings for each column index starting from the leftmost column and ending
 * on the rightmost column. There may be multiple nodes in the same row and
 * same column. In such a case, sort these nodes by their values.
 * 
 * Return the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
 * Output: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
 * Explanation:
 * Column -1: Only node 9 is in this column.
 * Column 0: Nodes 3 and 15 are in this column in that order from top to
 * bottom.
 * Column 1: Only node 20 is in this column.
 * Column 2: Only node 7 is in this column.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
 * Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
 * Explanation:
 * Column -2: Only node 4 is in this column.
 * Column -1: Only node 2 is in this column.
 * Column 0: Nodes 1, 5, and 6 are in this column.
 * ⁠         1 is at the top, so it comes first.
 * ⁠         5 and 6 are at the same position (2, 0), so we order them by their
 * value, 5 before 6.
 * Column 1: Only node 3 is in this column.
 * Column 2: Only node 7 is in this column.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,4,6,5,7]
 * Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
 * Explanation:
 * This case is the exact same as example 2, but with nodes 5 and 6 swapped.
 * Note that the solution remains the same since 5 and 6 are in the same
 * location and should be ordered by their values.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
 * 0 <= Node.val <= 1000
 *
